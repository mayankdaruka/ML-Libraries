At the core of the NumPy package is the ndarray object
    - n dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types


Difference between NumPy arrays and standard Python lists:
    - NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation
    - Changing size of ndarray will create a new array and delete the original
    - Elements in NumPy array must be the same data type
        - EXCEPTION - can have arrays of objects w/ diff size in memory
    - Facilitate more efficient operations on large amounts of data

Why is NumPy better/faster?
    - Vectorization - no explicit looping
    - Concise and easier to read
    - More closely resembles standard mathemtical notation

    - Implicit element-by-element behavior of operations
